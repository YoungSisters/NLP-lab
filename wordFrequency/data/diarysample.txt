Today I went to Bangalore railway station, Yeshwantpura, to receive my uncle and aunt who were coming from Mumbai. It was a bright sunny day. Sun was shining like a star. While I and my father were crossing the Orion mall, we saw three elephants that made me reminded of my Kerala trip.
Last year I went on a Kerala trip, where we visited around 5 cities like Cochin, Wayanad, Munnar, Kovalam, and Alappuzha. All the places were really awesome and beautiful. Then we went to Elephant junction Thekkady, Kumily, where people go for elephant rides. I rode sitting above the elephant around for 2 and half hours. Then we have also done elephant bath and feeding. We took a lot of pictures with elephants. It was a nice trip and I still canâ€™t get over it.
